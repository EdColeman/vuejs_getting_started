# vuejs_getting_started
Learning javascript using vue js (Created Jan 28, 2017)

## Motivation

Document the steps I am taking to learn javascript development. I am relatively new to javascript and this im my journey
Everything here should be considered as my development journal and nothing more. Specifically, please do not take 
anything here as being a best practice or a step-by-step guide.   

The end goal is to demonstrate a dynamic, single-page application that provides simplified, but similar functionality
as parts of the monitor that is provided with [Accumulo](https://accumulo.apache.org) with some new features for 
monitoring the Fault-Tolerant Executor (FATE) transaction system that is used in Accumulo.
   
While I have an end goal in mind, this repo may contain a lot of half-baked concepts as I explore different options
and techniques.
    
## Steps Overview

1. Step 0 - Install initial development environment for javascript development suitable for large projects
  Generated code in ./hello_vue_cli
2. Step 1 - Initial vue.js hello word (js only) and mock application layout using html / css.
  Code contained in ./proto1 

### Step 0 Goals:

See the README in ./hello_vue_cli for additional details - ths summary is here because the installation of node and yarn 
are global for a developer and do not need to be repeated for each project.
 
  * Setup a development environment that can scale to larger projects
